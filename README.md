HullOS Operating System for Hull Pixelbots. 

There are two versions, depending on which micro-controller you are using for your robot.

## Arduino Uno HullOS

This version is for the Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro-Mini 5v and Arduino Pro-Mini 3.3v. The Arduino C++ source is in the HullOS folder. Select the target device using the **Tools>Board** menu in the Arduino SDK which you can download from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). You will need to add the following libraries:

*  AdaFruit NeoPixel
*  EEPROM
*  TimerOne

Select the target device using the **Tools>Board** menu. 

## Raspberry Pi PICO and ESP-32 HullOS

The code for this version can be found [here](https://github.com/HullPixelbot/PICO-HullPixelbot)


## Python-Ish

There is a full specification of the "Python-ish" langauge in the HullOS specification document.

Have Fun
